**Living Textbook: CIDS 120 - Privacy, Vulnerability, and the Digital Age (Part 2)**

---

### Summary
This section explores the modern understanding of privacy in the digital era, the philosophical roots (or lack thereof) of privacy as a natural right, and how legal interpretations, especially those in American law, have evolved to incorporate protections for privacy. It also discusses psychological and social dimensions of privacy, emphasizing its connection to vulnerability, control, and consent.

### Privacy and Technology

In the modern world, the majority of privacy threats come from online environments. From identity theft to doxxing and phishing scams, online privacy concerns affect people of all ages—though older generations, often less digitally savvy, are particularly vulnerable.

One major threat is **phishing**, where a malicious actor pretends to be someone trustworthy to obtain sensitive information. While many of us undergo yearly privacy training that covers threats like phishing, the deeper question is why privacy matters in the first place.

### Is Privacy a Right?

The philosophical literature on privacy is surprisingly sparse. Historically, there has been little consensus on whether privacy is a natural or human right. While many today would affirm that privacy is a basic human right, this belief lacks firm grounding in centuries of ethical or philosophical tradition.

For example, there is **no reasonable expectation of privacy in public** in most U.S. states. Recording someone in public is not generally a violation of their rights, even if it may feel intrusive. This extends to the use of surveillance technologies such as drones—despite debates about personal space and airspace.

Philosopher Glenn Negley noted the ambiguity in treating privacy as a natural right. However, many argue that **privacy is essential for moral choice and action**. Consider the voting booth: its design ensures privacy so individuals can vote their conscience, free from external judgment.

### Privacy, Anonymity, and Expression

Anonymity often allows individuals to express their true thoughts without fear of social repercussion. Private Twitter or Reddit accounts, for example, often become platforms for more authentic—sometimes troubling—self-expression. Privacy thus supports freedom of conscience, but it also opens space for both morally good and bad behaviors.

This duality is reflected in the writings of **Jeremy Bentham**, who asserted that **law is itself an invasion of privacy**, justified only by utility. In other words, for a law to be ethically valid, it must result in greater societal benefit than harm caused by the privacy it violates.

### The Link Between Privacy and Vulnerability

A recurring theme is that we seek privacy when we are **vulnerable**:
- Biological needs (e.g., using the bathroom)
- Emotional states (e.g., crying, grieving)
- Moments of physical or social exposure (e.g., nudity, illness)
- Embarrassment or wrongdoing (e.g., lying, cheating)

Seeking solitude is a natural, possibly biological, response to vulnerability. Other animals also exhibit this instinct—sick dogs, for example, often isolate themselves. Humans are no exception.

**Bravery**, by contrast, may involve the deliberate exposure of one's vulnerability—standing tall, literally exposing one's vital organs, despite potential threat. This posture is seen as confident and assertive.

---

### Privacy, Consent, and Control

Privacy is closely tied to **consent** and **control**. To be vulnerable in the presence of another person often requires a deliberate choice—a granting of access. This applies to everything from sharing emotional experiences to lending someone your belongings.

Consent and control are particularly relevant in discussions of **private property** and **intellectual property**. For instance, owning a pencil or a hat grants the owner the right to exclude others from using it. Intellectual property laws function similarly for intangible creations like music or software.

### Legal Foundations of Privacy

American legal protections of privacy stem not from the U.S. Constitution directly—**the word "privacy" does not appear in the Constitution**—but from legal interpretations rooted in English common law and tort law. Notably, the 1890 article "The Right to Privacy" by **Warren and Brandeis** argued that legal protections should extend beyond physical harm to include personal information and emotional well-being.

They leveraged existing doctrines like:
- **Assault**: creating fear of harm without physical contact
- **Libel and slander**: reputational harm through false statements

These non-physical harms were legally recognized, suggesting that **privacy violations**, too, should be considered legitimate torts.

---

### Castle Doctrine and Property

The **Castle Doctrine** reflects the notion that one's home is a sanctuary. In many jurisdictions, individuals may use force, even lethal force, to defend their homes against unlawful intrusion. This extends the concept of privacy from personal space to property ownership.

Beyond physical property, privacy involves:
- **Private property** (e.g., homes, possessions)
- **Intellectual property** (e.g., music, code, artwork)
- **Personal autonomy** (e.g., bodily integrity, decision-making)

---

### Modern Challenges to Privacy

Technology has made privacy harder to maintain. Even without carrying a smartphone, devices like smartwatches constantly collect and transmit data. The rise of **photojournalism**, tabloids, and social media has eroded solitude and turned gossip into global news.

Though the Constitution does not mention privacy, certain amendments are interpreted to protect it:
- **First Amendment**: Freedom of association
- **Fourth Amendment**: Protection from unreasonable searches
- **Fifth Amendment**: Right against self-incrimination

These imply that privacy is foundational to personal freedom and justice.

### Final Thoughts

Privacy is not just a legal or technical issue—it is deeply connected to human dignity, vulnerability, and autonomy. In future lessons, we'll explore **four types of privacy invasions** and how digital technologies have made these more complex.

For now, reflect on the idea that **to control your vulnerability, you must also control your privacy**. And to control your privacy, society must value and protect it—legally, ethically, and personally.
