# CIDS 120 – The Right to Privacy: Legal Origins and Modern Invasions

## Summary
This section builds on our previous discussion of privacy by focusing on the landmark 1890 paper "The Right to Privacy" by Samuel Warren and Louis Brandeis. We examine their foundational ideas, especially the limitations they placed on the right to privacy, and how their arguments continue to influence legal interpretations today. We also introduce the modern framework for understanding four types of privacy invasion.

## The Significance of Warren and Brandeis

In 1890, Samuel Warren and Louis Brandeis published "The Right to Privacy" in the *Harvard Law Review*, formally articulating a concept of privacy as a legal right. Their argument was revolutionary for its time and has shaped modern legal thinking around the individual's right to control personal information and be left alone.

## Key Limitations Outlined by Warren and Brandeis

Warren and Brandeis proposed a robust defense of the right to privacy, but they acknowledged several limitations:

1. **Matters of Public or General Interest**
    - The right to privacy does not prohibit the publication of facts that are legitimately of public or general interest. This limitation draws on analogies with libel and slander law.
    - Example: Arrest records, public trials, and public health concerns are often considered within the public's right to know.

2. **Voluntary Public Exposure**
    - If a person voluntarily places themselves in the public eye—such as celebrities or public officials—they have a reduced expectation of privacy.

3. **Consent**
    - If someone consents to the disclosure or publication of private information, then their right to privacy is considered waived.

4. **Legal Obligations and Externalities**
    - If withholding information would result in harm to others, or if disclosure is mandated by law (e.g., criminal acts, sex offender registries), the right to privacy may be overridden.

These limitations remain widely accepted today and frame many of our current privacy debates.

## Public Interest vs. Personal Privacy

Privacy ends where the public’s right to know begins. This principle underpins legal precedents such as the publication of arrest records, public health notices, or the legal obligation of registered sex offenders to inform neighbors. Even celebrities, while entitled to some level of personal privacy, face reduced protection when in public spaces or when issues concern public interest.

A critical question we face today is: *Should the nature of an offense or the context of a public figure’s life affect how privacy is applied?* These questions are especially thorny in cases involving media coverage and evolving social norms around consent and exposure.

## Four Modern Types of Privacy Invasion

Legal scholars and courts today commonly refer to four distinct types of privacy invasion. These categories provide a structured way to evaluate claims of privacy violation in both legal and ethical contexts:

1. **Intrusion upon Seclusion**
    - Unwarranted and intentional invasion of someone’s private affairs.
    - Example: Unauthorized surveillance, hidden cameras, or accessing personal emails without permission.

2. **Public Disclosure of Private Facts**
    - Publishing private, non-newsworthy facts that would be offensive to a reasonable person.
    - Example: Sharing private medical records or embarrassing personal history without consent.

3. **False Light**
    - Publicly portraying someone in a misleading or deceptive way that is offensive, even if technically true.
    - Example: Using a photo out of context to imply involvement in something disreputable.

4. **Appropriation of Name or Likeness**
    - Using someone’s name, image, or identity for commercial gain without their consent.
    - Example: Using a celebrity’s photo in an advertisement without permission.

These categories help courts balance the competing interests of free speech, journalism, public interest, and individual dignity.

## Reflective Questions

- Should celebrities enjoy greater privacy protections, or does fame inherently limit their rights?
- Are all sex-related offenses equally deserving of public disclosure?
- How do cultural shifts and technological innovations affect our interpretations of what should be private?

## Coming Up Next

In our next lecture, we’ll delve deeper into the digital dimension of privacy invasions, exploring how companies, governments, and individuals collect and share private data. We'll also examine contemporary laws such as the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) and their attempts to rein in invasive practices.
