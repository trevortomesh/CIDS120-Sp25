**CS 120 - Ethical Treatment of Personal Information (April 11, 2025)**

### **Group Activity: Understanding Informed Consent**
Students worked in small groups to brainstorm scenarios requiring informed consent. Examples discussed:

- **Entering someone’s home**: Informed consent requires not just permission, but understanding of why you're entering, for how long, and for what purpose.
- **Medical decisions**: Especially relevant for surgeries or treatments, informed consent ensures the patient understands risks, benefits, and alternatives.
- **Using someone else’s belongings**: Consent must be based on full disclosure. For example, borrowing a lawnmower to drive to the store would likely elicit a different response than borrowing it to mow your lawn.
- **Recording or data collection**: Whether you're recording audio/video or gathering data for surveys or AI grading, consent should be both informed and voluntary.
- **Posthumous data usage**: Students brought up voice replication and likeness usage after death as an ethical frontier requiring prior consent.

### **Defining Informed Consent**

**Can someone truly agree to something if they don't understand it?** That is the fundamental question underlying informed consent.

Informed consent has three core components:
1. **Disclosure**: Providing all relevant information in an understandable format.
2. **Comprehension**: Ensuring the individual can grasp what is being disclosed.
3. **Voluntariness**: Consent must be given freely, without coercion or pressure.

### **Historical Origins: The Nuremberg Code (1947)**
The ethical foundation for informed consent was formalized after World War II during the Nuremberg Trials. The **Nuremberg Code** responded to horrific Nazi medical experiments conducted without consent.

**Key Principle:**
> *"The voluntary consent of the human subject is absolutely essential."*

Experiments cited included forced sterilization, extreme temperature exposure, and surgeries performed without anesthesia.

The code emphasizes:
- Legal capacity to consent
- Freedom from coercion, fraud, or duress
- Full understanding of risks and consequences

Though not a legal statute, the Nuremberg Code influenced:
- The **Declaration of Helsinki (1964)**
- The **Belmont Report (1979)**
- U.S. **federal research regulations** and **Institutional Review Boards (IRBs)**

### **Modern Ethical Dilemmas in Consent**

**Example: COVID-19 Vaccine Mandates**
- In Canada, citizens had to carry a QR code proving vaccination to access public spaces.
- Raises the question: *Was consent truly voluntary if participation in society required vaccination?*
- The class debated whether such mandates constitute coercion or justified public health measures.

**Other examples discussed:**
- Mandatory vaccines in dorms (MMR, meningitis): Are these coercive or responsible public health policy?
- Handwashing mandates tied to fines: Could AI-enforced surveillance be justified in extreme outbreaks (e.g., norovirus)?

### **Informed Consent in Tech**

**Tech applications require similar ethical rigor:**
- **App permissions** (location, camera, contacts, etc.): Users must be informed and free to deny access.
- **Push notifications**: Often a good example of opt-in consent.
- **Apple's ecosystem** was praised for granular consent prompts.

**Common pitfalls:**
- **Jargon overload**: If a user doesn’t understand what they're consenting to, it doesn’t count.
- **Implied coercion**: E.g., extra credit in exchange for signing a petition.
- **Nonrenewable consent**: Consent must be ongoing and revocable.

### **Informed Consent in Research and Healthcare**
- **HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act)**: Ensures patient confidentiality in U.S. healthcare.
- **FERPA (Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act)** applies to educational institutions.

In studies involving human participants (e.g., stress testing), participants must:
- Know the risks
- Have the option to stop at any time
- Understand how their data will be used

---

### **Key Takeaways**
- Informed consent is an *ethical process*, not just a legal checkbox.
- It applies across fields: medicine, education, tech, research, and government policy.
- Respecting autonomy means ensuring understanding, voluntariness, and transparency.

> *"Ethics must come before science. Respect for persons must never be sacrificed for the supposed greater good."* — Conclusion from the Nuremberg Code

Next Class: We will explore how these principles apply in the tech industry, particularly around data collection and surveillance systems.
