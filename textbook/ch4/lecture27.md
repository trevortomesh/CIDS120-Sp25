# Living Textbook: Privacy, Data Collection, and Ethics in the Digital Age

## Quick Semester Update

As of April 23, 2025, all remaining CIS 120 sessions will be conducted online. The April 23rd class will be our last in-person meeting. On April 24th, the instructor's wife is undergoing major surgery. Beginning April 25th, class may be asynchronous with pre-recorded lectures or assigned activities. Live Zoom sessions will be offered, and recordings will be made available. The final exam will be conducted online.

## Data Collection and the Changing Landscape of Privacy

### The Cost of Storage
Modern data collection is made feasible by the astonishing decline in storage costs. For perspective:
- In 1956, 5 megabytes required a massive IBM unit the size of a filing cabinet.
- In 2020, 1 terabyte can be stored on a drive smaller than your hand.
- One terabyte = 1,000,000 megabytes, meaning modern devices can store millions of times more data than early computers.

This exponential improvement has fueled an information economy, tightly interwoven with the attention economy.

### You're Always Being Computed On
Whether via smartwatches, smartphones, or social media, users generate massive amounts of data:
- An Apple Watch alone can generate 10–25 MB of data per day.
- This includes heart rate, motion data, GPS data, and app usage.

This data can be stored indefinitely, reused for new purposes, and often isn't fully understood by the person it concerns.

## Key Methods of Data Collection and Processing

### Invisible Information Gathering
- Happens without the user's awareness.
- Examples: tracking time spent on a website, browser type, click behavior.
- Often justified as improving user experience.

### Cookies
- Small files stored on your device by websites.
- Enable persistence, like saving shopping cart contents.
- May seem benign but can be used for long-term behavioral tracking.

### Secondary Use
- Data collected for one purpose is used for another.
- Examples:
    - Salaries of public employees used in political campaigns.
    - Customer data sold to marketers or insurance companies.

### Data Mining
- Searching and analyzing massive datasets to extract patterns.
- ChatGPT and similar LLMs rely on data mining to produce intelligent responses.

### Computer Matching
- Combining multiple databases to extract insights.
- Used in everything from marketing to estimating public sector demographics.

### Computer Profiling
- Identifying behavioral patterns to predict future behavior.
- Used in targeted advertising (e.g., Google AdSense) and law enforcement.
- Controversial due to potential for discriminatory profiling.

## Ethics of Data Collection

### The Gold Standard: Informed Consent
Ethical data collection requires:
- **Informed**: Users know what data is collected, how it's used, who it's shared with, how long it's stored, and whether it's secure.
- **Consent**: Users voluntarily agree.

Examples:
- Medical ethics require informed consent before treatment.
- Apps should request permissions clearly and transparently.

### Violations and Real-World Examples
- Facebook, Snapchat, Pokémon Go, and others collect location, contacts, and personal habits.
- In some cases, data is collected about minors or without meaningful consent.

## Trade-Offs and Considerations
- Convenience vs. privacy: Users often sacrifice privacy for smoother UX.
- Ethics vs. business: Companies balance profitability with responsibility.
- Legal frameworks (like GDPR and CCPA) aim to enforce standards, but user understanding is limited.

## Key Terms
- **Cookies**: Files saved by websites to track preferences and behavior.
- **Invisible Information Gathering**: Data collection without the user's explicit knowledge.
- **Secondary Use**: Using collected data for unintended or undisclosed purposes.
- **Data Mining**: Extracting patterns from massive datasets.
- **Computer Matching**: Combining records from different databases.
- **Computer Profiling**: Predicting behaviors from user data.
- **Informed Consent**: The gold standard for ethical data use.

## Questions for Discussion
1. Would you be comfortable allowing a company to use your data for marketing if it made your life more convenient?
2. Have you ever read an end-user license agreement (EULA)? Should companies be required to simplify them?
3. Is it ethical to use someone’s data if they click "Accept" but didn’t fully understand what they agreed to?
