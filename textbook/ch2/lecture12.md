**CS 120 - Lecture Summary: Free Speech & Cancel Culture (February 24, 2025)**

---

### **Summary**
This lecture continued the discussion on free speech, focusing on its limitations, academic freedom, and the rise of cancel culture, especially in relation to social media. We examined how the United States differs from other countries in free speech protections, explored the concept of academic freedom through the "sifting and winnowing" principle at the University of Wisconsin, and delved into the complexities of cancel culture with various real-world examples.

### **Key Concepts**

#### **1. Free Speech in the United States: Rights and Limitations**
- **Expansive Protections:** The U.S. protects even offensive or extreme speech (e.g., advocating for genocide without credible threat).
- **Limitations on Free Speech:**
    - **Direct and Credible Threats:** Speech that incites imminent violence is not protected.
    - **Defamation:** Includes libel (written) and slander (spoken), involving false statements that damage reputations.
    - **Confidentiality Breaches:** Violating non-disclosure agreements or legally sworn secrecy.
- **Social vs. Legal Consequences:** Legal protections don't shield individuals from social backlash or criticism.

#### **2. Academic Freedom and the University of Wisconsin’s Legacy**
- **Academic Freedom:** Essential for inquiry, allowing students and faculty to explore and express ideas without fear of institutional censorship.
- **Sifting and Winnowing:**
    - Originated from the University of Wisconsin Board of Regents in 1894.
    - Promotes fearless pursuit of truth through open inquiry and debate.
    - Upholds the right to present and critique ideas, even if offensive or unpopular.
- **Example Case:** Richard T. Ely, an economics professor accused of promoting socialism, was exonerated under the principle of academic freedom.

#### **3. Historical Lessons on Speech Curtailment and Consequences**
- **Speech Suppression Leading to Violence:** Restricting free expression can foster resentment and, historically, has preceded societal violence (e.g., French Revolution, rise of totalitarian regimes).
- **Scientific Suppression:** Soviet rejection of Darwinian evolution (favoring Lysenkoism) led to mass crop failures and millions of deaths.

#### **4. Cancel Culture: Definition and Impact**
- **Definition:** Social phenomenon where individuals or entities face public backlash, boycotts, and ostracization due to perceived harmful actions or speech.
- **Forms of Cancel Culture:**
    - **Public Accountability:** Holds people and organizations responsible for their actions.
    - **Boycotts:** Withdrawing support to pressure change.
    - **Public Shaming:** Social media-driven campaigns can lead to job losses or loss of platforms.

#### **5. Case Studies and Real-World Examples**
- **Stephen Colbert Controversy (2014):**
    - Satirical tweet (lacking context) sparked outrage and the #CancelColbert movement.
    - Raised questions about satire, intent vs. impact, and the dangers of decontextualization on social media.
- **Corporate Cancel Culture:**
    - **Bud Light Boycott:** Conservatives boycotted the brand over LGBTQ+ representation, resulting in significant sales declines.
    - **Target:** Faced backlash from both conservatives (for LGBTQ+ merchandise) and liberals (for removing DEI programs), highlighting the difficulty companies face in balancing public sentiment.
- **Academic Cancel Culture:**
    - **Hamline University Case:** A lecturer showing historical Islamic art faced backlash and was not re-hired, demonstrating tensions between academic freedom and student sensitivities.
    - **Public vs. Private Institutions:** Public universities like the University of Wisconsin are bound by the First Amendment, while private schools are not.

#### **6. Cancel Culture and Free Speech Tension**
- **Debate:** Balancing freedom of speech with social accountability.
- **Partisan Nature:** Both conservative and liberal groups engage in cancel culture to enforce ideological standards.
- **Economic Power of Consumers:** Boycotts serve as a form of “voting with your dollar” in capitalist systems.

### **Practice Questions**
1. How do the legal and social consequences of speech differ in the U.S.?
2. What is the "sifting and winnowing" principle, and why is it significant?
3. Why can curtailing speech lead to violence historically?
4. How does cancel culture intersect with free speech rights?
5. Compare and contrast conservative and liberal examples of cancel culture.
6. Why do public universities have different speech obligations than private ones?
7. How do boycotts serve as a form of economic activism?
8. In what ways can social media amplify or distort speech controversies?
