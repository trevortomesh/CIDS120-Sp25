### **Social Contract Theory and the Foundations of American Ethics**

#### **Introduction**
- Review of the Declaration of Independence, the U.S. Constitution, and the unique American perspective on ethics.
- Social Contract Theory: essential to understanding how the U.S. government and its legal framework operate.

### **Social Contract Theory**
- Originated from Thomas Hobbes, who survived the English Civil War.
- Hobbes argued that people in a society implicitly agree to:
    1. A set of moral rules to govern relations among citizens.
    2. A government capable of enforcing those rules.
- This agreement forms the **social contract**.

#### **Rights in Social Contract Theory**
Rights are categorized into two broad types:

##### **Negative Rights**
- Rights that can be ensured if individuals are simply left alone.
- The **Bill of Rights** in the U.S. Constitution consists mostly of negative rights.
- Examples:
    - **Free Speech** (1st Amendment): You can speak freely without government interference.
    - **Freedom of Religion** (1st Amendment): The government cannot interfere with religious practices.
    - **Right to Bear Arms** (2nd Amendment): The government cannot prevent individuals from owning firearms.
    - **Right to Remain Silent** (5th Amendment): Protection against self-incrimination.
    - **Privacy Rights**: Recognized but debated in scope.

##### **Positive Rights**
- Rights that require action from others or the government.
- Examples:
    - **Right to an Attorney**: If you cannot afford one, the government must provide one.
    - **Right to Education**: K-12 education is provided by the state.
    - **Parental Responsibilities**: Parents must provide children with shelter, food, and care.
- Debate exists over the legitimacy of positive rights, with strict libertarians arguing they infringe on others' rights.

#### **Absolute vs. Limited Rights**
- **Absolute Rights**: Rights that cannot be restricted under any circumstances.
    - Free speech (though limited in cases of direct harm, like threats).
    - Freedom of religion.
- **Limited Rights**: Rights that can have restrictions based on circumstances.
    - **Right to Vote**: Limited by age and citizenship.
    - **Right to Education**: Only applies to K-12 students.
    - **Right to Own Firearms**: Varies by state and local laws.
    - **Right to Protest**: Allowed but cannot infringe on others' rights.

#### **Challenges of Social Contract Theory**
- No one explicitly signs the social contractâ€”it is assumed.
- Some rights conflict with each other (e.g., right to protest vs. right to access education).
- Difficult to apply to complex modern issues.

### **The U.S. Constitution and Its Foundations**
- The Constitution is **not a rulebook for individuals**, but an **operating manual for the government**.
- The first attempt at governing, the **Articles of Confederation**, failed due to weak federal power.
- The U.S. is a **Democratic Republic**, not a direct democracy, due to concerns about the **tyranny of the majority**.

#### **Influences on the U.S. Constitution**
- **John Locke**: Natural rights (life, liberty, property), government by consent.
- **Montesquieu**: Separation of powers.
- **Voltaire**: Free speech and religious freedom.
- **Rousseau & Hobbes**: Social contract theory.

#### **The Bill of Rights**
- First 10 amendments to the U.S. Constitution.
- Limits **government power**, rather than granting rights.
- Common phrasing: **"Shall not be infringed"**, **"No law shall"**, etc.

#### **Comparison: U.S. Bill of Rights vs. Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms**
- **Canadian Charter:** Rights **granted** by the government and subject to "reasonable limits."
- **U.S. Bill of Rights:** Rights **inherent** to individuals, and the government is explicitly restricted from infringing on them.
- **Key Difference:** In the U.S., rights come from **a higher source** (Declaration of Independence states they are "endowed by their Creator").

#### **Conclusion**
- The U.S. system is based on the idea that rights exist **prior to government**.
- The Constitution does not create rights but **prevents the government from infringing upon them**.
- This principle distinguishes the U.S. from other democratic nations.
