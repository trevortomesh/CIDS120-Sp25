# **CIS 120 - February 3, 2025**

## **Value Inventory and Moral Philosophy**

Welcome back! Today, we're discussing the **value inventory** worksheet that I assigned. Itâ€™s important that you take this exercise seriously because understanding your personal values is key to navigating the complexities of life.

We live in a world filled with existential crisesâ€”climate change, nuclear threats, political instability, and more. To face these challenges, you must develop a **clear moral philosophy**.

One thing that frustrates me is when people attempt to dictate morality to others **without first understanding their own values**. Before you can advocate for a moral system, you must be able to **articulate and defend** your own beliefs.

- What do you believe?
- Why do you believe it?
- Have you reasoned your way into this belief, or is it inherited from a tradition?

Take this worksheet **seriously**, because self-reflection is the foundation of ethical decision-making.

## **Relativism: Subjective and Cultural**

Weâ€™ve been discussing **moral relativism**, the idea that there is **no universal right or wrong**.

### **1. Subjective Relativism**

**Definition:** Each person determines their own moral code, deciding what is right and wrong based on their personal beliefs.

#### **Arguments in Favor**:
- Rational people can disagree on moral issues.
- No one is all-knowing, so how can anyone claim to be objectively correct?

#### **Problems with Subjective Relativism**:
- If morality is entirely personal, then **no action** can be judged as immoralâ€”including things like genocide or slavery.
- No justification for punishing anyone:
    - If all morality is relative, then a murderer could argue that their actions were **"right" for them**.

### **2. Cultural Relativism**

**Definition:** Each **society** determines what is morally acceptable. Outsiders **cannot** judge another cultureâ€™s moral choices.

#### **Arguments in Favor**:
- Different societies have different moral systems, so morality must be relative.
- It avoids **cultural arrogance** and **ethnocentrism**.

#### **Problems with Cultural Relativism**:
- Just because a culture **accepts** something does not mean it is **right** (e.g., slavery in the 1800s, the Holocaust).
- Many societies **share common values**â€”murder is generally considered wrong worldwide.
- If cultural relativism is true, then we **cannot** say past atrocities (e.g., Nazi Germany) were objectively wrong.

#### **Class Poll: "Societies cannot rightly judge other societies."**
**Do you agree or disagree?**  
(A) Strongly Agree  
(B) Agree  
(C) Disagree  
(D) Strongly Disagree

**Discussion:**
- Some argue that morality evolves and societies **progress**.
- However, if we believe in moral progress, doesnâ€™t that imply **some moral values are superior**?
- This contradiction is a fundamental problem in cultural relativism.

## **Ethical Egoism: The Morality of Self-Interest**

### **Definition:**
Ethical egoism is the belief that **each person should act exclusively in their own self-interest**. The **morally correct action** is the one that maximizes **personal** long-term benefit.

#### **Famous Ethical Egoists**:
- **Ayn Rand** (Objectivism)
- **Anton LaVey** (Founder of the Church of Satan, which is an atheist ethical egoist philosophy)

### **Arguments in Favor**:
- Ethical egoism is **practical**â€”if everyone looks out for themselves, society might function better.
- A little **self-interest** can actually be **beneficial to others** (e.g., politicians pass laws that help people to gain popularity).
- **Taking care of yourself** prevents **dependency** on others.

### **Problems with Ethical Egoism**:
- It can justify **immoral behavior** (e.g., lying, stealing, harming others).
- Leads to **selfishness**, making a person unpleasant to be around.
- Societies cannot function if **everyone** prioritizes their own needs **over** the well-being of others.

#### **Real-Life Example:**
- **Helping others for personal benefit:**
    - If a doctor studies hard to **maximize their own success**, they **also** help society by saving lives.

### **Conclusion:**
Ethical egoism is **self-centered** but has **practical** applications. However, taken to an extreme, it **undermines** social cooperation.

## **Upcoming Topics: Rules-Based Ethics**

On **Wednesday**, weâ€™ll discuss **Kantianism** and **Utilitarianism**, two ethical systems that attempt to define universal moral **rules**.

## **Practice Questions**

1. **Critical Thinking:**
    - If subjective relativism is true, can we ever say that someone elseâ€™s moral beliefs are wrong? Why or why not?

2. **Application:**
    - Consider a society where theft is considered morally acceptable. According to **cultural relativism**, would it be justified for outsiders to criticize or intervene? Explain your reasoning.

3. **Analysis:**
    - Ethical egoism suggests that people should only act in their **own self-interest**. Can you think of a scenario where self-interest leads to a positive outcome for **both the individual and society**? Explain.
