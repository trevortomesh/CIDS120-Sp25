### **Review: Utilitarianism**

Before diving into Kantianism, let’s briefly revisit **utilitarianism**, which we covered in our last session:

- **Definition**: Utilitarianism is an ethical theory that determines right and wrong based on the principle of maximizing happiness (also called the **greatest happiness principle**).
- **Types**:
    - **Act utilitarianism**: An action is morally right if it maximizes overall happiness.
    - **Rule utilitarianism**: We should follow moral rules that, if followed by everyone, produce the greatest happiness.
- **Criticism**:
    - Just because something makes people happy doesn’t mean it is good (e.g., drug use might make people happy but isn't beneficial).
    - It allows for the tyranny of the majority (e.g., stealing from one person to benefit the group).
    - Practically impossible to calculate happiness accurately.

### **Kantianism**

**Immanuel Kant** proposed an ethical theory fundamentally different from utilitarianism. His theory is based on reason and duty, rather than happiness.

#### **Key Principles of Kantianism:**

1. **Moral laws are universal:**
    - Moral actions should be based on universal rules that apply to all people in all situations.
    - If an action is morally correct, it must be **logically consistent** for everyone to follow it.

2. **Moral laws should be based on reason:**
    - Unlike **divine command theory**, where morality is determined by religious teachings, Kant believed morality should be rooted in rational thought.

3. **Happiness is irrelevant:**
    - Unlike utilitarianism, Kantian ethics does not focus on happiness but rather on what we **ought** to do.
    - The right action is based on **duty**, not personal desires.

#### **Kant’s Categorical Imperatives**

Kant formulated two key **categorical imperatives**:

1. **Universalizability Principle**: *Act only according to a rule that you would want to become a universal law.*
    - Example: If lying were universally accepted, trust in communication would collapse.

2. **Humanity Principle**: *Treat people as ends in themselves, never merely as a means to an end.*
    - Example: Using someone for personal gain (e.g., being friends with someone only for their money) violates this principle.

#### **Criticism of Kantianism**

- **Conflicting duties**: Kantian rules can sometimes contradict each other (e.g., “Do not lie” vs. “Protect others from harm”).
- **Too rigid**: Kant’s theory does not allow exceptions, even in extreme circumstances (e.g., lying to protect innocent people).

### **Virtue Ethics**

Virtue ethics, an ancient Greek ethical theory, offers an alternative perspective. **Aristotle** developed this approach, emphasizing **moral character over strict rules.**

#### **Key Principles of Virtue Ethics**

1. **Virtue and Habit:**
    - Good moral character is developed through **practice**.
    - Example: Practicing honesty makes a person naturally truthful.

2. **Moral Excellence:**
    - People should strive to reach their **highest potential**.
    - Two types of virtue:
        - **Intellectual virtues** (e.g., wisdom, rationality)
        - **Moral virtues** (e.g., courage, honesty, generosity)

3. **Moral Living Matters:**
    - Unlike Kantianism or utilitarianism, **virtue ethics focuses on moral wisdom, emotions, and personal growth**.
    - Ethical living is **not just about following rules** but about becoming a virtuous person.

#### **Criticism of Virtue Ethics**

- **What is virtue?**
    - Unlike Kantianism, which provides strict moral rules, virtue ethics is **more subjective**.
    - Different cultures and individuals may define virtue differently.

- **Lack of clear guidelines:**
    - No absolute rules for right and wrong.
    - Leaves room for personal interpretation, which may lead to ethical disagreements.

### **Comparing the Theories**

| Theory          | Focus       | Key Question | Example Decision |
|---------------|------------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Utilitarianism** | Happiness/Consequences | Will this action create the most happiness? | Lying to protect a friend is okay if it maximizes happiness. |
| **Kantianism** | Duty/Rules | Can this action be universal? | Lying is always wrong, even to protect a friend. |
| **Virtue Ethics** | Moral Character | Does this action reflect a virtuous person? | A virtuous person would be honest but also compassionate. |

### **Discussion Questions**

1. **The Nazi at the Door Thought Experiment**: Suppose you are hiding innocent people in your attic during wartime, and soldiers come asking if they are there. According to Kant, you must tell the truth. Do you agree? Why or why not?

2. **The Poker Dilemma**: Poker relies on deception (bluffing). Does that make playing poker morally wrong under Kantianism? How would virtue ethics evaluate it?

3. **White Lies**: If a child asks if Santa Claus is real, is it morally wrong to say yes? Which ethical theory would support your decision?

4. **Means vs. Ends**: Have you ever had a job just for the paycheck? Did you feel like you were being treated as a means to an end? How does Kantianism apply?

5. **Character Development**: Can you think of a habit you have developed over time that has made you a more ethical person? How does this relate to virtue ethics?

### **Key Takeaways**

- **Utilitarianism** focuses on happiness and consequences.
- **Kantianism** focuses on duty and universal moral laws.
- **Virtue ethics** focuses on moral character and personal growth.
- **No single theory is perfect**—each has strengths and weaknesses.

Next session, we will cover **Social Contract Theory**, which examines how moral rules are shaped by agreements in society.
