**CIDS 120 - Ethical Theories and the Is-Ought Problem**

### Introduction
Welcome back. Today is January 31, 2025, and this is **CIDS 120**. As we continue our discussion on ethical theory, we will delve into the **is-ought problem**, originally articulated by the Scottish philosopher **David Hume**. This concept is crucial to understanding the foundation of ethical reasoning, particularly in a world that values scientific reasoning and logic.

### The Is-Ought Problem
David Hume proposed that **we cannot logically derive an "ought" statement from an "is" statement**. For example, while we can state the fact that people are starving, there is no purely logical way to conclude that we *ought* to feed them without a pre-existing moral framework. The bridge between facts and moral imperatives requires an external ethical system.

Despite our tendency to separate facts and values, we frequently assign moral significance to facts. We say, "It is bad that people are starving," but this statement already presupposes a moral stance. This creates a challenge: how do we justify ethical actions without inherent logical necessity? Ethics serves as the framework for bridging this gap.

### Ethical Frameworks and Their Importance
Because logic alone cannot derive moral duties, societies develop **ethical frameworks** to determine what ought to be done. However, there is no universal agreement on a single correct ethical system. Even within the same cultural context, individuals can arrive at vastly different moral conclusions. For instance, when faced with the ethical dilemma of finding money, some may choose to return it, some may keep it, and others may find a compromise. These decisions are influenced by personal and societal moral frameworks.

### The Enlightenment and Ethical Evolution
The **Enlightenment**, a period of intellectual and philosophical development in the 1600s and 1700s, fundamentally reshaped ethical thought. It emphasized **reason, individual rights, and personal liberty**, shifting societies away from rigid hierarchical structures. Thinkers such as **David Hume, Thomas Hobbes, and John Locke** contributed to these ideas. The United States itself was founded on **post-Enlightenment principles**, such as democracy and individual freedoms.

### The Fact-Value Distinction and Pragmatism
Most modern philosophy maintains the **fact-value distinction**, asserting that facts exist independently of moral values. However, **pragmatists** challenge this by suggesting that moral propositions are valid if they are **useful or effective**. Early human societies often operated under pragmatic ethics—assigning values to facts for survival. For example, teaching children not to cross the street without looking both ways is a pragmatic moral rule rooted in safety rather than abstract moral reasoning.

### Ethical Misapplications: Historical Examples
History offers many cautionary tales where **ought statements were derived from questionable is statements**, leading to atrocities:
- **The Ukrainian Genocide (Holodomor, 1930s):** The Soviet government controlled food production in Ukraine, justifying widespread starvation through ideological reasoning.
- **The Holocaust:** Hitler used Germany’s post-WWI economic despair to justify genocide.
- **Mao’s Great Leap Forward:** Policies justified by economic ideology led to the starvation and deaths of millions.

These examples demonstrate that **deriving ought from is without critical scrutiny can lead to catastrophic consequences**.

### Ethical Theories: An Overview
To navigate ethical dilemmas, different ethical theories have been developed over time. We will begin by exploring **Divine Command Theory** and **Relativism**, two opposing perspectives.

#### Divine Command Theory
One of the oldest ethical frameworks, **Divine Command Theory**, holds that morality is dictated by God’s will, as revealed through religious texts. For example:
- **Judaism, Christianity, and Islam** derive moral principles from sacred texts such as the Torah, Bible, and Quran.
- **Catholicism** relies not only on the Bible but also on the **Catechism**, which provides moral guidance on contemporary issues.

However, Divine Command Theory has several challenges:
1. **Requires belief in God** – If someone does not accept the religious premise, the framework loses authority.
2. **Multiple interpretations** – Different religions and even sects within the same religion disagree on moral tenets.
3. **Conflict with modern values** – Religious texts do not address all contemporary ethical issues (e.g., internet ethics, artificial intelligence).

Despite these limitations, Divine Command Theory provides a **clear, structured moral framework** for believers.

#### Relativism
At the other extreme is **Relativism**, which denies universal moral truths and holds that morality is subjective:
- **Subjective Relativism:** Morality varies from **person to person**.
- **Cultural Relativism:** Morality varies **between cultures**.

A case for relativism arises from the observation that intelligent, rational individuals often disagree on ethical issues. For example, in a poll conducted in class regarding **abortion when the mother’s life is not in danger**, responses varied widely. This suggests either **there is no objective moral truth, or some individuals are irrational**.

While relativism allows for **cultural diversity and individual freedom**, it raises concerns such as moral inconsistency and the inability to condemn harmful practices universally.

### Conclusion
Understanding the **is-ought problem** and various **ethical theories** provides a foundation for deeper discussions on morality. We will continue by examining **cultural relativism** and other ethical frameworks in our next class.
