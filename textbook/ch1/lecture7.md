## Ethical Frameworks and the Enlightenment

### Review of Virtue Ethics
Virtue ethics is the idea that good people enjoy doing good things, while bad people do not. Practicing virtue develops moral character, while indulging in vice weakens it. This framework, attributed primarily to Aristotle, predates the Enlightenment and focuses on personal moral development.

### Introduction to the Enlightenment
To understand the significance of social contract theory, it is essential to grasp the historical context of the Enlightenment. The Enlightenment was a transformative period from the 1500s to the 1700s, primarily in Europe, where ideas of reason, science, and individual rights began to take root. The United States, as one of the first post-Enlightenment cultures, was deeply shaped by these philosophical developments.

#### Pre-Enlightenment Life
Before the Enlightenment, society was characterized by strict hierarchies, religious dominance, and brutal living conditions:
- **Social Structure**: Society was divided into rigid classes:
    - **Clergy**: Religious elites who controlled education and literacy.
    - **Nobility**: Land-owning aristocrats who wielded power.
    - **Commoners**: Peasants, artisans, and merchants, most of whom had little social mobility.
- **Government**: Absolute monarchies ruled by divine right, with no democratic processes.
- **Religion and Education**: Knowledge was controlled by religious institutions, and books were rare and expensive.
- **Daily Life**: Disease, famine, and war were rampant; medicine was primitive, and justice was often arbitrary.

### The Renaissance and Early Scientific Revolution
Between the 1300s and 1600s, rediscovering Greek and Roman knowledge fueled new humanist ideals. Key developments included:
- **The Printing Press (1440)**: Allowed wider distribution of books and knowledge.
- **Protestant Reformation (1517)**: Challenged religious monopolies on knowledge and power.
- **Scientific Revolution**: Figures like Copernicus, Galileo, and Newton introduced empirical observation and reason-based inquiry.
- **Philosophical Shifts**: Thinkers like Francis Bacon formalized the scientific method, setting the stage for rational, structured inquiry into natural laws.

### Enlightenment Philosophers and Their Influence
Several Enlightenment thinkers laid the groundwork for modern government and ethics:
- **Thomas Hobbes (1651)**: Believed people are naturally selfish and require a governing authority to maintain order.
- **John Locke (1689)**: Argued that individuals have natural rights to life, liberty, and property.
- **Montesquieu (1748)**: Advocated for separation of powers, influencing the U.S. Constitution.
- **Voltaire (18th century)**: Championed free speech and religious tolerance.
- **Jean-Jacques Rousseau**: Developed social contract theory, arguing that government must reflect the general will of the people.
- **Thomas Aquinas (1225-1274)**: Earlier than the Enlightenment but highly influential, he argued that the universe is rational and governed by discoverable laws, reinforcing ideas of natural law and reason-based ethics.

### The Social Contract
The shift from monarchies to government by the people necessitated a new way of organizing society. Social contract theory, introduced by Hobbes and later refined by Locke and Rousseau, asserts:
1. **People agree to a set of moral rules to govern interactions.**
2. **A governing body enforces these rules to maintain order.**

By living in society, individuals implicitly accept laws and government authority in exchange for security and rights.

### Rights and Liberties
Enlightenment thought introduced the idea that individuals possess inherent rights. These rights are categorized as:
- **Negative Rights**: Rights that require others to leave individuals alone, such as freedom of speech, religion, and privacy.
- **Positive Rights**: Rights that require action from others, such as education and healthcare.

### The Path to the U.S. Constitution
The Enlightenment directly influenced the founding of the United States:
- **The Thirty Years' War (1618-1648)**: Demonstrated the dangers of religious absolutism, leading to greater calls for freedom of belief.
- **Locke's Natural Rights**: Inspired the Declaration of Independence.
- **Montesquieu's Separation of Powers**: Shaped the structure of the U.S. government.
- **Voltaire’s Advocacy for Free Speech and Religion**: Reflected in the First Amendment.
- **Rousseau’s Social Contract**: Provided a framework for democracy.

### Looking Ahead
Understanding these frameworks helps contextualize modern discussions on ethics, government, and individual rights. Next, we will delve deeper into how these Enlightenment ideas were directly incorporated into the Declaration of Independence and the U.S. Constitution.
