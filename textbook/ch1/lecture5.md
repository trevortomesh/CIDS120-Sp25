## Ethical Egoism Recap

- Ethical egoism states that each person should **focus exclusively on their own self-interest**.
- For an action to be considered ethical, it must benefit the individual performing it.
- "Ego" means **self**, so ethical egoism is about **self-interest as the foundation of morality**.
- Discussed **pros and cons** of ethical egoism.

## Enlightenment and Ethical Theories

- The Enlightenment emphasized **individual rights and autonomy**.
- Developed from the idea that every person has **intrinsic value**.
- Led to the belief that individuals should be **free** to make their own choices.
- Influenced by philosophers like **John Locke, Rousseau, and Voltaire**.

## Utilitarianism: The Greatest Happiness Principle

### Definition

- **Utilitarianism**: The idea that an action is ethical if it maximizes **overall happiness** and minimizes **unhappiness**.
- Originated with **Jeremy Bentham and John Stuart Mill**.
- **Utility**: The tendency of an action to produce happiness and prevent suffering.
- Principle of Utility: _An action is right or wrong to the extent that it increases or decreases the total happiness of the affected parties._

### Example: Office Space Movie

- The protagonists in _Office Space_ steal fractions of pennies from transactions.
- The company **doesn't notice**, so their unhappiness **remains unchanged**.
- The employees **become much happier** because they are getting rich.
- **Utilitarian argument**: If the net happiness increases, the action is justified.
- **Problem**: An accounting mistake leads to much larger thefts, making the company notice and suffer, making it **less ethical**.

### Helping Others: A Simple Utilitarian Example

- Helping an elderly person cross the street increases happiness for both parties.
- Utilitarian **win-win**: The person is helped, and the helper feels good about it.

## Two Types of Utilitarianism

### **Act Utilitarianism**

- **Definition**: An action is ethical **if it maximizes utility** in that specific situation.
- Example: Choosing whether to attend class based on whether it benefits your future.
- Weigh the pros (long-term benefits) and cons (short-term discomfort).

### **Rule Utilitarianism**

- **Definition**: We should adopt **moral rules** that, if followed by everyone, **maximize overall happiness**.
- Example: Laws against theft:
    - Theft benefits the thief but causes great harm to the victim.
    - A society where **no one steals** produces **more overall happiness**.
    - Thus, **a rule against stealing is justified**.

## Application to Decision-Making

- **Social decisions**: Where to eat with friends?
    - Choosing a restaurant involves **weighing group happiness**.
    - A compromise (e.g., **Jimmy John’s**) might not be anyone’s favorite but is acceptable to everyone.
- **Government decisions**: Laws are often based on **maximizing utility**.
    - Good laws aim to make **as many people happy as possible**.

## Strengths of Utilitarianism

- **Comprehensive**: Can be applied to **any ethical dilemma**.
- **Flexible**: Takes **real-world consequences** into account.
- **Objective**: Uses a clear principle: _maximize happiness, minimize suffering_.

## Counterarguments to Utilitarianism

- **Justice Issue**: What if maximizing happiness means sacrificing the rights of a few?
    - Example: Punishing an innocent person if it makes the majority feel safer.
- **Measurement Problem**: How do we **accurately measure** happiness?
- **Tyranny of the Majority**: If most people want something, does that make it right?
    - Example: A majority deciding to take rights away from a minority.

## Group Activity

- **Break into small groups** and come up with **a counterargument** against utilitarianism.
- Discuss a situation where utilitarianism might **justify an unethical action**.
- Share findings with the class.

## Practice Questions

1. **What is the key difference between Act Utilitarianism and Rule Utilitarianism?**
2. **Provide an example of a real-world law that follows the principle of Rule Utilitarianism. Explain how it maximizes happiness.**
3. **What is one major criticism of utilitarianism, and how might a utilitarian respond to it?**
