# Identity and Social Media: A Critical Exploration

**CS 120 – March 14, 2025 (Pi Day Lecture)**

### Overview

In this section, we explore how identity is shaped, reinforced, and sometimes distorted through social media. We examine research-backed phenomena such as social contagion, self-image distortion, cyberbullying, and algorithmic feedback loops—especially as they affect adolescents and young adults. We also dive into controversial and emerging topics such as digital influence on gender identity and other performative subcultures.

## Social Media as an Identity-Shaping Force

Social media is not just a communication tool—it has become a social force that both reflects and reshapes individual identity. Your social identity today is often influenced, curated, and broadcasted through platforms like Instagram, Snapchat, TikTok, and YouTube. But this influence is not neutral. The ways in which we portray ourselves, and the ways we are perceived online, have real-world consequences on our sense of self.

### Self-Image and Social Contagion

**Self-image** is a person’s perception of their own appearance, abilities, and personality. Platforms like Instagram and Snapchat, being highly visual, foster environments where users—especially young women—compare themselves to filtered, idealized versions of others. This has given rise to a phenomenon known as **social contagion**.

**Social Contagion:** Behaviors, emotions, and ideas that spread through a population via social and observational learning.

#### Real-world Examples of Social Contagion:
- Fashion trends
- Eating habits
- Social behaviors (e.g., smoking, drinking)
- Identity labels

### Research Highlights:
- **Christakis and Fowler (2007):** Demonstrated that obesity can spread through social networks—even without physical proximity—highlighting that behaviors can be socially contagious.
- **Burger and Heath (2005):** Showed that identity-signaling behaviors (e.g., fashion, music preferences) spread among adolescent peer groups.

Adolescence is a time of **neuroplasticity**—a brain’s heightened ability to form new pathways. It’s also a time of high **peer influence**, making adolescents especially susceptible to social contagion.

## The Distortion of Self-Image

Social media platforms facilitate constant comparison to idealized others. The **Dove Self-Esteem Project (2023)** found:
- 8 in 10 girls report filtering or editing their appearance before posting a photo.
- 67% say they attempt to change their appearance based on what they see online.

This creates a dangerous feedback loop:
1. Edited images are posted.
2. Others see them and feel inadequate.
3. They edit and post their own images.
4. The cycle repeats, amplifying self-dissatisfaction.

**Facebook's Internal Research Leak (2021)** revealed:
- 32% of teen girls said Instagram made them feel worse about their bodies.
- 6% of teens with suicidal ideation linked it directly to Instagram use.

## Quantifying the Crisis

- **Twenge and Campbell (2018):** Reported a 70% increase in depressive symptoms among adolescent girls between 2010–2016.
- **CDC (2023):**
    - 57% of high school girls reported persistent sadness/hopelessness.
    - 30% seriously considered suicide (up from 19% in 2011).

These years correlate directly with the proliferation of:
- Instagram (2010)
- Snapchat (2011)
- TikTok (2016)

**Common Sense Media (2022):** Average teen screen time exceeds 8.5 hours/day.
**Pew Research (2022):**
- 95% of teens use YouTube
- 67% use TikTok
- 62% use Instagram

### Regression Analysis Summary (Instructor Research):
- **Slope:** +0.78 (Teen depression rises 0.78% for every 1% rise in social media use)
- **R² Value:** 0.86
- **Pearson Correlation Coefficient:** 0.93
- **P-value:** < 0.00001 → Strong statistical significance

## Gender Identity and Social Contagion

This is a complex and controversial topic, but it’s worth exploring.

### Tavistock Gender Clinic (UK):
- Referrals rose from 77 in 2009 to over 5,300 in 2021.
- Majority: biological females aged 12–17 (historically dysphoria affected mostly males).

### Lisa Littman (2018):
- Coined **Rapid-Onset Gender Dysphoria (ROGD)**
- Found 87% of cases involved peer groups with multiple simultaneous transitions
- 62% increased social media use before adopting new gender identities

### Other Contributing Factors:
- Influence of trans influencers
- Algorithmic echo chambers reinforcing identity shifts
- Online exposure to new labels (e.g., xenogender, genderfluid)

**CDC & Pew Research:**
- 5.1% of teens now identify as transgender or non-binary (up from 0.5% a decade ago)

This rapid shift raises questions—are such identity shifts purely due to biological self-discovery, or is there an element of social contagion involved?

---

## Broader Performative Subcultures

Other conditions showing similar trends of identity adoption through digital communities:
- **Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID)**
- **Autism, ADHD, Tourette’s Syndrome**
- **Neurodivergent Aesthetic Subcultures**

Some researchers argue these shifts reflect **performative subcultures** rather than traditional clinical diagnoses—especially when self-diagnosis occurs via social media discourse.

## Summary: Social Media and Identity Formation

Social media is a double-edged sword. While it enables self-expression and connection, it also facilitates:
- Distorted self-image
- Increased depressive symptoms
- Algorithmic feedback loops
- Contagious spread of unhealthy behaviors

As digital natives, we must become critically aware of how our identities are shaped online and strive for **intentional self-reflection over algorithmic reinforcement**.

---

### Reflection Prompt:
- In what ways has your digital life shaped your sense of identity?
- Do you feel empowered or constrained by the way you present yourself online?

> “We are not just who we think we are, but who the algorithm shows us we should be.”
