# The Enchanted Slate of Glass: The Power and Problems of Mobile Computing

## Introduction

In today's digital age, mobile computing has become an essential part of our daily lives. From **communication and entertainment** to **education and global politics**, smartphones shape the way we interact with the world. However, while mobile computing provides **unprecedented convenience**, it also presents significant challenges—**addiction, distraction, and ethical concerns**. This lecture examines both the **power** and **problems** of mobile computing and how intentional design can offer solutions.

## **1. The Enchanted Slate of Glass – The Power of Mobile Computing**

The smartphone is arguably **the most powerful tool ever created by humans**—not necessarily in raw computational power, but in **societal influence**. It enables us to:

- Stay **connected** with family, friends, and global events
- Access **education and wellness apps** (e.g., MyFitnessPal, meditation apps)
- Engage in **global affairs** (e.g., Ukraine using Telegram for secure communications)
- Exercise **freedom of speech** in a digital public square

Yet, despite these advantages, smartphones wield immense control over **our attention and behavior**.

## **2. On Wings of Wax – Addictive Design**

Many mobile apps are designed **not just to be useful, but to be addictive**.

### **The Attention Economy**
Social media platforms such as **Facebook, Twitter (X), Instagram, and TikTok** generate revenue by keeping users engaged for as long as possible. Their business model is built on advertising, meaning **the more time users spend on these platforms, the more money these companies make**. Users are not the customers—they are the **product** being sold to advertisers.

### **The Science of Addiction**
Social media exploits well-known psychological principles:

#### **Intermittent Positive Reinforcement (IPR)**
Borrowed from behavioral psychology, **IPR keeps users engaged through unpredictable rewards**—just like a slot machine:

- **Facebook’s Like Button (introduced in 2009)** functions as a dopamine trigger.
- **Pull-to-refresh mechanics** mimic slot machine behavior—users keep swiping, hoping for something new.
- **Infinite scrolling** ensures that content never runs out, making it hard to stop.

#### **Push Notifications – The Attention Hijacker**
Originally introduced for business efficiency (**BlackBerry, 2003**), **push notifications** evolved into a means of controlling user attention:

- They **interrupt** and demand immediate engagement.
- They **create a sense of urgency** (e.g., “Your friend just followed AvocadoToast, join them!”).
- They **reinforce compulsive behaviors** by constantly pulling users back into apps.

**Outcome:** Users become **conditioned to check their phones habitually**, often without conscious thought.

## **3. Intentionality – The Antidote to Toxic Design**

### **Lessons from the Amish**
Contrary to popular belief, the Amish do not reject technology outright. Instead, they **evaluate whether a technology strengthens their values**. Their criteria:

- **Does this technology enrich our relationship with God, family, and community?**
- **Does it serve us, or do we serve it?**
- **Does it reinforce meaningful interactions?**

This selective approach to technology adoption offers a valuable lesson: **Intentionality in technology use can prevent compulsive behaviors.**

## **4. Absolving the Loom – Designing for Intentionality**

### **Principles of Intentional Design**
To counteract addictive design, we should **prioritize tools that serve the user** rather than exploit their attention. The following heuristics can guide better technological choices:

1. **Don’t ask, “Will this hurt my values?” Ask, “How will this strengthen my relationship with my values?”**
2. **A tool that can do anything often helps you do nothing.**
    - Smartphones, as Turing-complete devices, can simulate any computable task. This leads to **distraction rather than productivity**.
3. **A tool must serve the user, not the other way around.**
    - **Push notifications** should not dictate when we use technology.
4. **It should be obvious when a tool’s job is done.**
    - Games like **Wordle** provide a great example—one puzzle per day enforces a natural stopping point.
    - **Pagination** (as seen in Google search results) prevents **infinite scrolling**, encouraging users to pause and reflect.

## **Conclusion**

Mobile computing is both a **powerful enabler** and a **potential trap**. While it has revolutionized communication, productivity, and entertainment, it has also led to increased **distraction, addiction, and loss of intentionality**. By designing and using technology **with purpose**, we can reclaim control over our attention and live more balanced digital lives.

### **Discussion Questions**
1. **How has mobile computing positively or negatively impacted your daily life?**
2. **What are some examples of addictive design patterns you’ve encountered in apps?**
3. **How can we apply the Amish model of intentionality to our own use of technology?**
4. **What changes could social media platforms make to prioritize user well-being over engagement?**
5. **What strategies can individuals adopt to reduce phone addiction?**
