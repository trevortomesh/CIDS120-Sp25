# CIDS 120 Lecture Notes - February 2025

## Recap of Last Week

Last week, we covered a variety of topics, primarily focusing on:

- **Hate speech and cancel culture**:
    - Discussed how cancel culture exists on both sides of the political spectrum.
    - Explored the definition of hate speech and how difficult it is to measure hate.
    - Examined how different countries handle hate speech (e.g., U.S. vs. other nations).
- **Corporate cancel culture**:
    - Examples included Bud Light, John Deere, Target, and Chick-fil-A.
- **Academic cancel culture**:
    - Briefly mentioned "canceled" figures in academic discourse.
- **Social media introduction**:
    - Segued into the role of social media in shaping modern information landscapes.

## Defining Media & Social Media

- **Media** is a channel of information, a way to convey emotion, expression, and ideas.
- **Traditional Media** includes books, TV, newspapers, radio, and physical art.
    - Typically follows a **one-to-many** model (one broadcaster, many recipients).
    - Expensive to produce and distribute.
- **New Media** emerged with computers and the internet.
    - Includes digital media: video games, blogs, vlogs, podcasts, interactive displays, digital art.
    - More distributed, inexpensive, and allows for collaborative engagement.
- **Social Media** is a subset of new media that is:
    - Entirely **user-generated** content.
    - **Decentralized**: everyone is both a creator and a consumer.
    - **Highly interactive**.
    - **Low cost**.
    - **Real-time**: Enables immediate access to breaking news and discussions.

## Social Media and the Information Explosion

- Platforms like **Twitter/X, Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, and Twitch** allow for instant news updates.
- Example: Tracking **Pope Francis' health updates** in real-time rather than waiting for mainstream media reports.
- 2020 Protests: Social media enabled live-streaming of events, showing raw, unedited perspectives that differed significantly from traditional news narratives.
- **Information Overload**:
    - More data is created every **minute** than in centuries past.
    - AI-generated content adds to the flood of misinformation.
    - Example: "AI Slop"—algorithm-generated media that is pervasive and often misleading.
- **Comparing Dystopian Visions**:
    - *1984*: Authoritarian control through oppression.
    - *Brave New World*: Control through distraction and entertainment.
    - Modern society seems to be heading toward *Brave New World*—where people are inundated with content and stop caring about truth.

## Platforms vs. Publishers

- **Traditional media** (e.g., newspapers, TV networks) are **publishers**.
    - They curate and take legal responsibility for their content.
- **Telecommunications** (e.g., telephone companies) are **platforms**.
    - They are **not responsible** for what users say or do.
- **Where does social media fit?**
    - This is at the heart of the **Section 230 debate** in the U.S.

## Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act

- Passed in 1996 to address **online speech and moderation**.
- **Key Provisions**:
    - **Immunity from liability (230(c)1)**: Platforms are **not** responsible for content created by users.
    - **Good Samaritan Provision (230(c)2)**: Platforms can **moderate content** in "good faith" without being classified as publishers.
- **Legal Challenges and Controversies**:
    - **Russ Albricht & Silk Road**:
        - Created a dark web marketplace with minimal oversight.
        - Despite Section 230, was sentenced to **life in federal prison** for enabling illegal activity.
    - **Backpage.com**:
        - Facilitated sex trafficking ads.
        - Argued Section 230 protection but was ultimately shut down, with executives convicted.
    - **Revenge Porn**:
        - Some sites exploited Section 230 to avoid liability.
        - Example: myx.com, later shut down.
    - **COVID-19 Misinformation Debate**:
        - Social media platforms faced criticism for both **allowing harmful misinformation** and **censoring content later proven true** (e.g., lab-leak theory).

## Social Media Censorship and Bias

- Section 230 **fuels allegations of censorship** from **both sides**:
    - **Conservative examples**:
        - **Steven Crowder**: Videos demonetized/restricted by YouTube.
    - **Liberal examples**:
        - **Black Lives Matter activists**: Posts on police violence removed or restricted.
- The debate: Should **Facebook, Twitter, TikTok** be responsible for what users post?
    - Are they **platforms** (like telephone companies) or **publishers** (like newspapers)?

## Looking Ahead: Government-Social Media Collusion

- On **Wednesday**, we will explore:
    - How **governments** influence social media moderation policies.
    - Cases where social media companies **collaborate with governments** for information control.
    - Why this should concern **both conservatives and liberals**.
