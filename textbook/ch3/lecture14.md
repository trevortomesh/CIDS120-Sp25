# CS 120 - Social Media & The Evolution of Media

**Date:** February 28, 2025

## Introduction
- Transitioning from the previous discussions on free speech to social media.
- The world runs on information, and social media is one of the most influential tools for distributing it.
- Some of the largest and most lucrative companies are based on social media and information exchange.

## The Most Influential Companies
- As of 2024, some of the largest companies by revenue:
    - Walmart
    - Amazon
    - Apple
    - UnitedHealth
    - Meta (Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp) with a market cap of $1.62 trillion.
    - TikTokâ€™s parent company, ByteDance, valued at over $400 billion.
    - Twitter (X) sold to Elon Musk for $44 billion.
- These companies wield enormous influence over public discourse and information flow.

## Defining Media
- **Media**: A channel for conveying information.
- **Traditional Media**: Books, newspapers, television, radio, physical art.
- **New Media**: Digital and computer-based media, including video games, blogs, vlogs, podcasts, and websites.
- **Social Media**: A subset of new media where users generate and interact with content in real-time.

## Traditional Media vs. New Media
- **Traditional Media**:
    - One-to-many model: a single broadcaster (TV, newspapers, books) to many consumers.
    - Expensive to produce and distribute.
    - Limited interactivity (e.g., TV broadcasts).
- **New Media**:
    - Made possible by computers and digital technology.
    - More interactive, can be many-to-many communication.
    - Includes digital platforms such as video games, blogs, and online publications.

## The Rise of Social Media
- **Social Media Characteristics**:
    - Entirely user-generated content.
    - Decentralized interactions (users interact directly with each other).
    - Many-to-many communication instead of one-to-many.
    - Real-time updates and interactions.
    - Community-driven discussions and engagement.
    - Low-cost (or no-cost) access for users.
    - Algorithmically curated content.

## The Role of Algorithms
- **Algorithms in Social Media**:
    - Determines what content users see based on engagement, preferences, and behaviors.
    - Helps filter out irrelevant or low-quality content.
    - Can lead to echo chambers and content bubbles.
    - Can be manipulated for profit or influence (ads, misinformation).

## Conclusion
- Traditional media is centralized and expensive, while new media, especially social media, is decentralized and user-driven.
- Social media platforms are some of the most influential entities in the modern world.
- Algorithms shape the experience and impact of social media, for better or worse.
- Next class: deeper discussion on algorithms and their effects on social media engagement.
