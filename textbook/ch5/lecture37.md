# ⚖️ Ethics & Implications of Generative AI  
**Lecture Date**: May 7, 2025  
**Course**: CIDS 120 – Introduction to Computing and Society  

## Summary  
In this concluding lecture on AI, we turned to ethical concerns, risks, and societal impacts. Dr. Tomesh revisited the enormous computational and environmental costs of LLMs and discussed concerns about hallucinations, misinformation, bias, job displacement, and the lack of regulatory frameworks. We also explored unsupervised learning and the way LLMs "learn" to generalize categories. The session concluded with open questions about the trajectory of AI development and its philosophical implications for intelligence and society.

## Key Concepts
- **Environmental Impact**: High energy consumption of AI models, especially in training phases.
- **Hallucinations**: LLMs generating false but plausible-sounding information.
- **Bias in Training Data**: Inherited and sometimes amplified societal biases.
- **Job Displacement vs. Augmentation**: Debating whether AI replaces or enhances human labor.
- **Regulation & Transparency**: Need for governance, accountability, and ethical use.
- **Multimodal AI**: GPT-4 and successors can process both text and images.
- **Emergent Capabilities**: Surprising features that arise from scale and training—e.g., translation, reasoning.

## Optional Exercises
1. **Discussion**: Should AI tools like ChatGPT be regulated like public utilities? Why or why not?
2. **Essay Prompt**: Are LLMs “intelligent”? Defend your answer using examples from lecture.
3. **Scenario**: You are designing an AI to assist in healthcare. What ethical safeguards must be in place?
