# Chapter: Introduction to Large Language Models (LLMs)

## Overview
In this section, we explore large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, explaining what they are, how they work, what they can and cannot do, and why they matter. We also begin engaging with the ethical and philosophical questions surrounding their use, especially when such tools attempt to enforce or encode moral standards.

## A Personal Note
Before diving in, I want to take a moment to thank you all for your patience during a difficult week. My wife underwent a successful kidney transplant, and your flexibility allowed me to be by her side throughout. Your understanding meant a great deal—thank you.

## Timeline Check
We now have just a few class days remaining: today, Friday, Monday, Wednesday, and Friday again. Please note:
- A paper is due **Monday**
- A quiz is due **this Friday**
- A final quiz on LLMs will be due the **following Friday**

## Warm-up Reflection
Students were asked to test the boundaries of ChatGPT over the weekend—probing for its ethical limits. While few students reported success in “breaking it,” this segues naturally into a broader discussion: *Who defines these ethical boundaries?* And more intriguingly: *Should tools even have ethics?*

## What Are LLMs?
A **large language model** is a type of artificial intelligence trained to understand and generate human-like language. Examples include:
- ChatGPT
- Google Gemini
- Grok

While often described as "AI," LLMs are not intelligent in any conscious or sentient sense. Rather, they are trained on *probability models*.

### Analogy: Predictive Text on Steroids
Think of how your smartphone suggests words when you type. LLMs do the same thing—but using massive datasets and advanced neural network architectures. They predict the next most likely word (or token) based on what has come before.

#### Examples:
- "Mary had a little..." → "lamb"
- "I pledge allegiance to the..." → "flag"

This is **not** because the model "knows" what it is saying. It simply calculates what comes next based on training.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Tokens
Tokens are individual units of text. A word like "cat" may be one token, while a longer word or punctuation might be broken down into multiple tokens.

### 2. Training Data
LLMs are trained on massive amounts of text data: books, articles, websites, forums, etc. They do not understand this information—they recognize *patterns* in it.

### 3. Neural Networks
Inspired by how neurons in the brain fire and connect, neural networks process and weight information through connected layers. These networks enable the model to learn patterns across many layers of abstraction.

## How Do LLMs Work?

### Training Phase
- Billions of lines of text are fed into the model.
- The model adjusts **weights** and **parameters** to predict the next token more accurately.

### Inference Phase
- A user provides a prompt.
- The model outputs the most probable response based on its training.

### Transformers and Attention
Modern LLMs use transformer architectures with **attention mechanisms**, which allow the model to focus on relevant information even when it's not most recent. This keeps responses coherent.

- Creative writing

### Customer Service
- Chatbots trained on FAQs and policies

### Education
- Tutoring
- Language translation
- Essay feedback

### Programming
- Code generation and explanation

### Research and Business
- Literature review support
- Hypothesis generation
- Data analysis

## Limitations

### 1. Hallucination
LLMs sometimes generate false but plausible-sounding information—referred to as "hallucination." For example, confidently stating that Abraham Lincoln invented the toaster.

### 2. Lack of True Understanding
LLMs do not *know* anything. They do not have beliefs, opinions, or comprehension. They manipulate language, not meaning.

### 3. Ethical Biases
The ethical rules LLMs follow are designed by their creators. For instance, ChatGPT refuses to generate firearm blueprints—even when doing so may be legal in some jurisdictions. This raises questions about:
- Whose ethics are encoded?
- Should tools impose moral boundaries?

### 4. Context Window
Models can only remember a limited amount of text. Long conversations or documents may be truncated or cause the model to "forget" earlier parts of a conversation.

### 5. Data Privacy
Since models are trained on public text, they may inadvertently leak information that was publicly available but still sensitive.

## Ethical Reflections
We close with several open-ended questions:
- Should tools enforce moral standards?
- Who decides what an LLM can or cannot say?
- Are there dangers in over-relying on systems that do not understand meaning?

On Friday, students will engage in an activity reflecting on their own concerns around LLMs.

## Summary
LLMs are not thinking entities. They are advanced pattern-recognition machines trained on massive textual datasets. They can assist with writing, coding, customer support, education, and more—but they are also fallible, biased, and constrained by design. As their use grows, so too must our critical engagement with the assumptions behind them.
