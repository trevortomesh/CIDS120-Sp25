# ðŸ§  The Rise of AI: From Turing to Transformers  
**Lecture Date**: May 5, 2025  
**Course**: CIDS 120 â€“ Introduction to Computing and Society  

## Summary  
This lecture continues our exploration of large language models (LLMs) and AI, placing them in historical context. We reviewed Alan Turingâ€™s foundational contributions, such as the Turing Machine and the Turing Test, and traced the development of AI through the 20th century to the deep learning revolution. We discussed early AI programs like ELIZA, the hype and disillusionment cycles of the "AI winters," and the eventual emergence of probabilistic learning models. The lecture closed by examining how deep learning, massive data sets, and transformer architectures enabled the rise of systems like ChatGPT.

## Key Concepts
- **Alan Turing & Turing Machine**: The conceptual foundation for modern computation.
- **Turing Test**: A machine is intelligent if it can imitate a human in conversation.
- **AI Winters**: Periods of decreased funding and interest due to overhyped expectations.
- **Expert Systems**: Rule-based systems used in the 1980sâ€“1990s, now mostly obsolete.
- **Supervised vs. Unsupervised Learning**: Learning with vs. without labeled data.
- **Deep Learning & Neural Networks**: Layers of artificial neurons enabling pattern recognition.
- **Transformers (2017â€“present)**: Architecture that underpins GPT-style models.
- **GPT Timeline**:
  - GPT-1 (2018): Proof of concept.
  - GPT-2 (2019): Surprising fluency.
  - GPT-3 (2020): 175B parameters, capable of deep conversations.
  - ChatGPT (2022): Reinforcement learning from human feedback.
  - GPT-4 (2023): Multimodal, more accurate and nuanced.

## Optional Exercises
1. **Reflection**: Is the Turing Test still a valid measure of intelligence in 2025?
2. **Short Answer**: Describe the main difference between supervised and unsupervised learning.
3. **Creative Task**: Write a short dialogue with ELIZA. How does it compare to ChatGPT?
